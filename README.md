I have 3 years experience as a Data Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services, Client - M&G Plc.
- Transformed legacy machine learning models to Python, and developed ML models namely XGBoost, Decision Trees, Logistic, and Linear Regression as per business requirements.
- Built pipelines for Data sourcing, Data cleaning, and extracting meaningful information from data using PySpark, SQL, and ML and streamlined predictive modeling for product-based data resulting in savings of $128,000.
- Developed efficient ETL processes using AWS Glue and Spark, resulting in a 30% decrease in data processing time.
- Collaborated with cross-functional teams to identify and resolve data quality issues, improving overall data accuracy by 15%.
- Created Tableau dashboards to visualize and analyze large datasets, leading to a 30% increase in data-driven decision-making across the organization.
- Analyzed SQL queries extensively, and applied database normalization, yielding a 30% system performance enhancement.


EDUCATION:
- Master of Science in Data Science, The University of Texas at Arlington with 3.7/4.0 GPA on May 2023.

- Relevant Coursework: Python, Statistical Analysis, R, Predictive Modeling, Data Visualization, Data Science, Feature Engineering, Deep Learning, Neural Networks, CNN, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Apache Hadoop, MapReduce, Apache Spark, Scala, Genome Analysis, High-Performance Computing, Project Management.


SKILLS:
Python, Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow, Matplotlib, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, C++, LLMs, Diffusion Models, Apache Spark, AWS, SQL, ETL


ACADEMIC ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
1) [Gradio GenAI and LLM Deployment](https://github.com/vijayvthamalla/Gradio_GenAI_Deployment)
- Deployed Generative AI models and LLMs using Gradio with just a few lines of code. This will help in producing a POC within a very short period.
- Deployed models can be accessed using a public link to get feedback from end clients with zero knowledge of technical concepts.
2) [ML Deployment with Flask, Docker and Cloud](https://github.com/vijayvthamalla/End_to_End_ML)
- Trained Machine Learning models, saved the model using Pickle and served the model using Flask (API, web deployment).
- Containerized the application with Docker and deployed it to cloud platforms like Heroku and GCP.
3) [EDA and Machine Learning modeling](https://github.com/vijayvthamalla/EDA_and_Model_Building)
  - Exploratory data analysis and stacked Machine Learning models for high generalization with trade-offs in computation.
4) [Web scraping, Data Wrangling, and Machine Learning modeling of data](https://github.com/vijayvthamalla/Data_science)
  - Web scraping using Beautiful Soup, data wrangling using pandas, and comparison of ML models and explanation
5) [Working and analyzing Big Data Frameworks](https://github.com/vijayvthamalla/Big_Data_Analysis)
- Performed Big Data Analysis using Apache Hadoop in Java and Apache Spark using Scala for comparative analysis.
- Improved processing speed using Caching, Parallelization, and Data Serialization techniques.
